Creating a weather information app using React.js is an excellent project to enhance our skills in API integration, state management, and building responsive user interfaces. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you build such an app:

üå§Ô∏è Overview of the Weather App
The weather app will allow users to:
GitHub

Search for any city to get current weather details.

View information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Handle errors gracefully when a city is not found.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
React.js: For building the user interface.

Vite: A build tool that offers a faster development experience.

OpenWeatherMap API: To fetch real-time weather data.

Axios: For making HTTP requests.

Tailwind CSS (optional): For styling the application.

üß± Step-by-Step Guide
1. Initialize the React App
Use Vite to set up a new React project:


bash
Copy
Edit
npm create vite@latest react-weather

cd react-weather

npm install

npm run dev

This will start the development server at http://localhost:5173/.



2. Set Up the OpenWeatherMap API
Create an account on OpenWeatherMap and obtain your API key.

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your API key:

env
Copy
Edit
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Note: Vite uses the VITE_ prefix for environment variables.
